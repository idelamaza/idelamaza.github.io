## About me
{: style="text-align: center;"}
---

My name is Iñigo de la Maza, I am an industrial engineer currently writing my Master Thesis at MIT on the development of computational models of blood coagulation under flow conditions. I am applying machine learning, mathematical modeling of systems biology and computational statistics techniques to understand the mechanisms behind unknown blood clotting phenomena and find direct applications in cardiovascular pharmacology. 

I discovered my passion about data analytics around two years ago and I haven't stopped learning about this field eversince, whether it was with books, MOOC's or MIT courses. This is the place where the journey gets documented.

An updated copy of my resumé can be downloaded [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/files/Resume_delaMaza.pdf). However, here are some facts about me:
  * Responsible, hard-working, adaptable and very motivated industrial engineer with a strong interest in data analytics, optimization, artificial intelligence and machine learning
  * Proven abilities to work independently and under high pressure
  * Passion for problem solving and constant personal growth
