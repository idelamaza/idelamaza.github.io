This is the final project for MIT 15.095 _Machine Learning Under a Modern Optimization Lens_, by [Prof. Dimitris Bertsimas](https://www.mit.edu/~dbertsim/).

## Introduction

Online apps are a key element in the democratization of education all over the world, specially
when it comes to early childhood education. Developing software focused to improve how kids
learn is essential to make an impact on the users’ abilities and skills. In this work we present an
optimization-based approach to understand the relationship between the educational content of the
PBS KIDS Measure UP! app and how effectively its users learn. This is part of the 2019 edition
of the Data Science Bowl. 

We tackle the problem using a feature extraction process focused on
exploiting the time series nature of the data and the application of different Optimal Classification
Tree models in order to both achieve a high predictive power and gain interpretable insights. Our
models allow us, at the moment this report is being written, to achieve a predictive power better
than 95% of the best models submitted in the competition and to understand which factors drive
the children’s performance. Additionally, we provide two ideas of how this work could continue
leveraging the potential of optimization-based approaches.
