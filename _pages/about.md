## About me
{: style="text-align: center;"}
---

I'm a passionate Data Scientist, highly skilled in machine learning, data visualization, and creative thinking, with proven ability to explain and present mathematical concepts and results to technical and non-technical audiences. I am currently working at MIT on the development of high-dimensional mathematical models of biomedical systems, and their application to the development of novel antithrombotic drugs. 

I have recently graduated from both a M.Sc. in Industrial Engineering and a MBA, which have equipped me with a holistic approach to a broad variety of problems, and provided me with a solid theoretical basis of computational science, operations, and business strategy.

I'm always looking to leverage my multidisciplinary background to help solve challenging data-centered problems. An updated copy of my resum√© can be downloaded [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/files/Resume_delaMaza.pdf).
