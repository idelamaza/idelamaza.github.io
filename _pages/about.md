## About me
{: style="text-align: center;"}

My name is IÃ±igo de la Maza, I am an industrial engineer currently writing my Master Thesis at MIT on the development of computational computational models of blood coagulation under flow conditions. I am applying machine learning, mathematical modelling of systems biology and computational statistics techniques to understand the mechanisms behind unknown blood clotting phenomena and find direct applications in cardiovascular pharmacology. I discovered my passion about data science about two years ago and I haven't stopped learning about this field eversince, whether it was with books, MOOC's or MIT courses. This is the place where the journey gets documented.
