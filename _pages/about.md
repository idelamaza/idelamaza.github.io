### Background

My name is IÃ±igo de la Maza, I am an industrial engineer currently writing my Master Thesis at MIT on the development of computational computational models of blood coagulation under flow conditions. I am applying machine learning, mathematical modelling of systems biology and computational statistics techniques to understand the mechanisms behind unknown blood clotting phenomena and find direct applications in cardiovascular pharmacology.

I'm an industrial engineer currently writing my Master Thesis at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). 
Two years ago, my passion about data science began when working at the Technical University of Catalonia's Biomechanical Engineering Lab (BIOMEC). Having to dive into huge amounts of data generated in a project concerning the use of industrial exoskeletons in the automotive industry led me to discover the power of data analytics and artificial inteligence. I haven't stopped learning about this field eversince, whether it was with books, MOOC's or MIT courses. This is the place where the journey gets documented.
