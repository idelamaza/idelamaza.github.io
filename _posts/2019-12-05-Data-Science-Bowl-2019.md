This is worked served as the final project for MIT course 15.095: _Machine Learning Under a Modern Optimization Lens_, by Prof. Dimitris Bertsimas. A printer-friendly version can be downloaded [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/files/2019-12-05-Data-Science-Bowl-2019.pdf). All the used code can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/inigodelamaza). Special thanks to my colleague and co-author of the project, [Juan José Garau](http://systemarchitect.mit.edu/students.php#garau).

This project comprises the study of the application of predictive, optimization-based classification algorithms to a real-world task. Looking towards that aim, an online data science competition is the perfect medium due to both the availability of high-quality data, and the possibility of comparing different models and outcomes with the ones achieved by other participants using conventional heuristic methods. The online platform Kaggle is one of the most popular online competition organizer and 2019's edition of the Data Science Bowl® is a perfect fit for the objectives of thisproject.

## Introduction

Online apps are a key element in the democratization of education all over the world, specially when it comes to early childhood education. Developing software focused to improve how kids learn is essential to make an impact on the users’ abilities and skills. In this work, an optimization-based approach to understand the relationship between the educational content of the PBS KIDS Measure UP! app and how effectively its users learn is presented.

We tackle the problem using a feature extraction process focused on exploiting the time series nature of the data and the application of different Optimal Classification Tree models in order to both achieve a high predictive power and gain interpretable insights. Our models allow us, at the moment this report is being written, to achieve a predictive power better than 95% of the best models submitted in the competition and to understand which factors drive the children’s performance. Additionally, we provide two ideas of how this work could continue leveraging the potential of optimization-based approaches.
